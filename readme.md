This Calculator is designed to be just like... another calculator you can easily see on the web.
However, I intend to make this calculator using

1. html
2. css
3. webassembly with C++ and emscripten

I was gonna make this with pure openGL but I'm still loving my life so nah.

## Features

- Calculating simple equation


just that? yeah
  
## About Me
I'm a software engineer, from Indonesia


## To Run

1. npm run build
2. npm run start


just make sure emscripten is installed and em++ is in your path
